# Learning Progression Map

This repository is organized to clearly demonstrate my progression from security fundamentals
to applied offensive security concepts.

## Structure Overview

- Foundations: Core Linux, networking, and security methodology
- Web Application Security: OWASP Top 10 concepts and common vulnerability classes
- Enumeration & Exploitation: Structured reconnaissance and exploitation workflows
- Hands-on Practice: Practical labs documented separately in TryHackMe and Hack The Box sections

This structure allows recruiters and reviewers to easily see skill growth,
concept mastery, and ethical hands-on practice.

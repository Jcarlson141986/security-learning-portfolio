# Authenticated Web Application Authorization Assessment

## Overview

This project documents a structured authenticated security assessment performed against a role-based web application in a controlled lab environment.

The objective was to evaluate:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Server-side authorization enforcement
- CSRF protection mechanisms
- Parameter tampering resistance
- Session handling behavior

Testing was conducted using OWASP ZAP in proxy mode with manual request replay validation techniques.

---

## Scope

This assessment was performed against a simulated HR-style web application deployed in a private lab environment for professional development purposes.

No production systems, real domains, or organizational data were involved.

Application: Simulated HR Web Application (Lab Environment)

Roles Tested:
- Employee
- Supervisor / Manager

Focus Areas:
- Horizontal privilege escalation
- Vertical privilege escalation
- Sensitive action protection
- CSRF enforcement
- Parameter manipulation resistance

All endpoints are referenced generically (e.g., `/api/clock-in`, `/api/clock-out`) to maintain environment neutrality.

---

## Key Security Validations Performed

### 1. Role Abuse Testing (Vertical Privilege Escalation)

Test Method:
- Captured a supervisor-only export request
- Replayed the request using a lower-privileged session
- Validated server-side authorization enforcement

Result:
- Access denied
- No vertical privilege escalation observed
- Server-side role validation confirmed

---

### 2. Sensitive Action Validation

Sensitive functionality tested:
- Report export endpoint

Test Method:
- Unauthorized request replay attempts
- Session manipulation attempts

Result:
- Unauthorized requests rejected
- No sensitive data leakage observed
- Session enforcement properly validated

---

### 3. Parameter Tampering Testing

Endpoints tested:
- `/api/clock-in`
- `/api/clock-out`

Manipulations attempted:
- Modified form parameters
- Altered project identifiers
- Submitted malformed requests

Result:
- 403 Forbidden responses returned
- CSRF verification enforced
- No unauthorized time or data manipulation permitted

---

### 4. CSRF Protection Validation

Tests performed:
- Modified CSRF token values
- Removed CSRF token entirely

Result:
- 403 Forbidden responses
- Explicit CSRF validation failures observed
- Token missing or invalid requests properly rejected

---

## Security Posture Summary

Within the defined scope, the application demonstrated:

- Proper server-side authorization enforcement
- Effective RBAC separation between roles
- Correct CSRF protection implementation
- Parameter tampering resistance
- No observable privilege escalation vectors

No Critical or High severity vulnerabilities were identified during this assessment phase.

---

## Severity Classification Model

The following severity model was used for classification:

- **Critical** – Remote compromise or full data exposure
- **High** – Privilege escalation or unauthorized sensitive data access
- **Medium** – Security control bypass requiring specific conditions
- **Low** – Minor hardening recommendation
- **Informational** – Best practice observation

---

## Tools Used

- OWASP ZAP (Proxy + Manual Request Editor)
- Firefox (proxy configured)
- Manual authenticated request replay testing

---

## Conclusion

This authenticated authorization assessment phase is complete.

The tested lab application demonstrates strong role-based authorization enforcement and properly implemented CSRF protections within the defined scope.

Future assessment phases may include:

- Business logic abuse testing
- Automated scanning validation
- Advanced parameter fuzzing
- Session lifecycle edge-case testing

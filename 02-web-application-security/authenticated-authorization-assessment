# Authenticated Web Application Authorization Assessment

## Overview

This project documents a structured authenticated security assessment performed against a role-based web application in a controlled test environment.

The objective was to evaluate:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Server-side authorization enforcement
- CSRF protection mechanisms
- Parameter tampering resistance
- Session handling behavior

Testing was conducted using OWASP ZAP in proxy mode with manual request replay validation.

---

## Scope

Application: AlphaTimeHR (Test Environment)

Roles Tested:
- Employee
- Supervisor / Manager

Focus Areas:
- Horizontal privilege escalation
- Vertical privilege escalation
- Sensitive action protection
- CSRF enforcement
- Parameter manipulation resistance

---

## Key Security Validations Performed

### 1. Role Abuse Testing

- Captured supervisor-only export request
- Replayed request using a lower-privileged session
- Confirmed server-side authorization enforcement (access denied)

Result:
No vertical privilege escalation observed.

---

### 2. Sensitive Action Validation

Most sensitive action tested:
- Report export endpoint

Result:
- Unauthorized replay attempts rejected
- No sensitive data leakage
- Session enforcement validated

---

### 3. Parameter Tampering Testing

Endpoints tested:
- `/clock-in`
- `/clock-out`

Manipulations attempted:
- Modified form parameters
- Altered project identifiers
- Attempted malformed requests

Result:
- 403 Forbidden responses
- CSRF verification enforced
- No unauthorized time manipulation allowed

---

### 4. CSRF Protection Validation

Tests performed:
- Modified CSRF token
- Removed CSRF token completely

Result:
- 403 Forbidden
- "CSRF verification failed"
- Token missing or invalid requests rejected

---

## Security Posture Summary

The application demonstrated:

- Proper server-side authorization enforcement
- Effective RBAC separation between roles
- Correct CSRF protection implementation
- Parameter tampering resistance
- No privilege escalation identified

No Critical or High severity vulnerabilities were discovered during this assessment phase.

---

## Severity Classification Model

- **Critical** – Remote compromise or full data exposure
- **High** – Privilege escalation or unauthorized sensitive data access
- **Medium** – Security control bypass requiring specific conditions
- **Low** – Minor hardening recommendation
- **Informational** – Best practice observation

---

## Tools Used

- OWASP ZAP (Proxy + Manual Request Editor)
- Firefox (proxy configured)
- Manual request replay testing

---

## Conclusion

This authenticated authorization assessment phase is complete.

The tested application demonstrates strong role-based authorization enforcement and properly implemented CSRF protections within the tested scope.

Future assessment phases may include:
- Business logic abuse testing
- Automated scanning validation
- Advanced parameter fuzzing

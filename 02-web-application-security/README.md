## Featured Project – Authenticated Authorization Assessment

This project documents a structured authenticated security assessment performed against a role-based web application in a controlled lab environment.

Validated:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforcement
- Server-side authorization checks
- Privilege escalation resistance (horizontal & vertical)
- CSRF protection implementation
- Parameter tampering protections
- Session enforcement behavior

Tools Used:

- OWASP ZAP (Proxy + Manual Request Editor)
- Authenticated request replay testing
- Browser proxy configuration

Outcome:

No critical or high-risk vulnerabilities were identified within the defined test scope.
